1. The research question. It should be precise (NOT VAGUE), the hypothesis clear, and the metrics well defined.  
1. The necessary data. 

# Research Proposal: Fed Announcements

By Brian Fullenbaum, Jonah Nathan, Kyle Hodrick

## Research Questions

#### The Big Question
##### How do FED communications influence financial markets?
#### Our Specific Research Question
##### How does the sentiment of Federal Reserve FOMC statements affect short-term movements in Treasury yields and S&P500 indicies?

#### What are the relationships we are testing/What is our hypotheses?
- In our project we will be analyzing correlative relationships between sentiment and market movements in the S&P500.

- More positive sentiment in FOMC statements is associated with short term decreases in treasury yields and short term stock price increases for interest rate sensitive companies, particularly those in sectors like x, y, and z. And more negative sentiment in FOMC statements is associated with short term increases in treasury yields and short term stock price decreases for these same companies or sectors

- Could maybe add a hypothesis about how markets react more strongly when the sentiment of the Fedâ€™s statement changes a lot compared to the last one. Like if the Fed suddenly sounds much more optimistic or much more worried than before we could expect bigger changes in Treasury yields and the stock prices of companies that are sensitive to interest rates.

#### Metrics of Success
- 

2. If your project is about relationships, what are the hypotheses you're testing?
3. If your project is about prediction, what is your metrics of success? [(What are you maximizing?)](https://ledatascifi.github.io/ledatascifi-2025/content/05/03d_whatToMax.html) Can you find a baseline from prior work to give you a ball park to aim for?

## Necessary Data

This section should cover:
1. What does the final dataset need to look like (mostly dictated by the question and the availability of data):
   - What is an observation, e.g. a firm, or a firm-year, etc.
   - What is the sample period?
   - What are the sample conditions? (Years, restrictions you anticipate (e.g. exclude or require some industries)
   - What variables are absolutely necessary and what would you like to have if possible?
1. What data do we have and what data do we need?
2. How will we collect more data? 
1. What are the raw inputs and how will you store them (the folder structure(s) for each input type)? 
1. Speculate at a high level (not specific code!) about how you'll transform the raw data into the final form.
